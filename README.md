# Mistral 7B Fine-tuned on Midjourney Prompt Creation Dataset

This repository contains a Mistral 7B model fine-tuned on a custom dataset for midjourney prompt creation. The model is available for use via the Hugging Face Model Hub at the following link: [Mistral 7B Fine-tuned Midjourney Prompt Creation](https://huggingface.co/PunyaModi/mistral-7b-finetuned-Midjourney-prompt-v2).

## Introduction

The Mistral 7B model is a large language model that has been fine-tuned on a dataset specifically curated for midjourney prompt creation tasks. This model can be used to generate prompts or suggestions for various tasks, particularly those that require input or guidance midway through a process or journey.

## Usage

To use the Mistral 7B fine-tuned model for midjourney prompt creation, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here's a basic example of how to use it in Python:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("PunyaModi/mistral-7b-finetuned-Midjourney-prompt-v2")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("PunyaModi/mistral-7b-finetuned-Midjourney-prompt-v2")

def generate_prompt(input_text, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=3):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    output = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=num_return_sequences, temperature=0.7)
    return [tokenizer.decode(seq, skip_special_tokens=True) for seq in output]

input_text = "You're halfway through your project and feeling stuck. What should you do next?"
prompts = generate_prompt(input_text)
for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt)
```

In this example, `generate_prompt()` takes an input text representing the current state or context of the journey and generates multiple prompts for the next steps.

## Model Details

The Mistral 7B model is a powerful language model trained on a diverse corpus of text data. It has been fine-tuned specifically on a dataset tailored for midjourney prompt creation tasks, ensuring its effectiveness in generating relevant and coherent prompts for various scenarios.
